
This fork of Heimdall is intended to be temporary to add support for the
Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 GT-P7510.

My changes are released under the same license.

This code is about as experimental as it can get.
It likely breaks all the other devices that I don't have access to test with.

The source code is a real mess of experimentation and refactoring at this point
and probably doesn't even build except on Linux. Eventually, I'd like to get it
into good enough shape for upstream.

I don't recommend you flash your device with it unless you are equipped
to recover such a bricked device via JTAG (or are exceptionally brave).

Unfortunately, the flash dump capability seems to be disabled in these newer devices.
Perhaps it just needs a different command.

But I was able to retrieve my pit file with it, so that's progress.
